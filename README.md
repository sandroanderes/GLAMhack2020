# GLAMhack2020
 6th Swiss Open Cultural Data Hackathon

## About GLAMhack2020
The 2020 Edition of the **Swiss Open Cultural Data Hackathon** will take place on 5-6 June as an ONLINE hackathon. This edition is virtually hosted by the Swiss Institute for Information Science at the FHGR Chur, in collaboration with the Institute for Multimedia Production. The focus of the **GLAMhack** will lie on Linked Open Data, Machine Learning, Human-Computer-Interaction and Crowdsourcing. Once again, we are happy to collaborate with Wikimedia CH, infoclio.ch and other members of the Friends of OpenGLAM Network.

## Project Details
### Open Data Information
The Historical database of Le Temps comprises 3 newspapers over 200 years. The **Journal de Genève** ran from 1826 to 1998, the **Gazette de Lausanne** (under different names) from 1798 to 1998, and the **Nouveau Quotidien** from 1991 to 1998, before the merging to the present **Le Temps**. The full archive was digitized and OCRed (extraction of digital text) in 2008. The project is of interest for the community because newspaper databases are becoming a widespread reality across Europe, calling for dedicated techniques to fully exploit them.

### Idea
We would like to translate these historical newspaper articles from French to German using a public API (DeepL, Google Translate) and make them available to the German speaking public.
In addition, some important articles, such as articles about the First World War or the latent division of German-speaking Switzerland and the Romands, known as the "Röstigraben", will be elaborated in greater depth as headlines.
